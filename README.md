# Bike Share Analysis
In this project, l  used Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States.
I performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and wrote code to compute descriptive statistics. I also used a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help me for visualizing the data.
